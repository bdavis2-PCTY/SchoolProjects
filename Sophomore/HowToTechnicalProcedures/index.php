		<strong class='color3'>What are we</strong><br />
		We are a group who builds technical related tutorials. We focus on design and development of applications. HTTP is a business created by high-scholars for a class project.

		<strong class='color3'>Who are we</strong><br />
		The members of HTTP are all sophomores attending <a href='http://mtchs.org' target=_blank>Meridian Technical Charter High School</a>. We all chose the design and development pathway, where we will learn to use applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator, and Dreamweaver.
