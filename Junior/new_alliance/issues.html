						<h2>New Alliance Party Political Issues</h2>
						<p>View the problems that we're facing today in America. We have plans on specifically how to fix each issue.</p>
					</header>


					<br/><br/>
					<div id="waronterror">
						<strong>War on Terror</strong><br/>
						<blockquote>We need to get involved with the war on terror but only to a certain extent. We need to
						send supplies to the countries that are involved, such as weapons needed, ammunition and drill sergeant
						trainers. We will send troops to where they are needed, but only if the problem increases in power,
						otherwise we will only send the supplies that our allies need to assist in defeating terrorism.</blockquote>
					</div>


					<div id="guncontrol">
						<strong>Gun Control</strong><br/>
						<blockquote>We don’t want full gun control and we don’t want to take people's guns away. However,
						we do want to put restrictions on who can buy lethal firearms. In 2013 there was around 48,000
						gun accidents and the majority of them could have been prevented if the wrong people didn’t have
						dangrous weapons. We believe that anyone who has a firearm should be properly trained on how to
						use them and they should have to take some type of a test before they are eligible to purchase
						weapons. We believe that people should not be able to purchase firearms after two years of their
						first misdemeanor of their first non-violent felony so that way we can give them a second chance
						to redeem themselves but still stay safe on it. no one under the age of 21 will be able to purchase
						a gun without a training permit and a mental evaluation but must be over the age 18.</blockquote>
					</div>


					<div id="immigration">
						<strong>Immigration</strong><br/>
						<blockquote>Immigration should not be allowing themselves into the US and being able to work without
						going through the immigration process. any immigrant found in the us should be sent back to mexico.
						Mexican immigrants cost the US approximately $22 billion every year. instead of spending this money
						on dealing with the immigrants already here we will use this money to prevent more immigrants from
						coming into the USA. after the first year that should be enough to build this wall between the US
						and mexico. </blockquote>
					</div>


					<div id="marijuana">
						<strong>Marijuana</strong><br/>
						<blockquote>We think that recreational marijuana should be legal but one cannot have more than an
						ounce on their person at a time. If someone is found with more than an ounce, they will get a
						ticket worth $20 for every gram they have that is more than an ounce and it will be taken away.
						Marijuana will be taxed 10 cents a gram, this will help pump money into our government as well as
						making millions of Americans happy.</blockquote>
					</div>


					<div id="joboutsourcing">
						<strong>Job Outsourcing</strong><br/>
						<blockquote>Between December 2001 and December  2013 the United States has lost 3.2 million jobs
						to China alone and ⅔ (2.4 million) of those jobs were manufacturing jobs. Electronics and computer
						jobs were included in this ⅔ count and they account for 1.3 million of the 2.4 million jobs lost.
						On average this causes a $21.8 billion dollar loss in a year for the United States. A way that we
						can fix this is by creating more internal jobs rather than giving those jobs to foreign countries.</blockquote>
					</div>


					<div id="abortion">
						<strong>Abortion</strong><br/>
						<blockquote>Abortion should be legal as long as both parents are consentive, if only the mother
						is present, then it is up to her. Abortion should be legal because not everyone can support a child,
						and many women are being forced to having a child that they were involuntarily given due to rape.
						Even if the woman wasn’t raped, it should still be up to her whether she wants the child. </blockquote>
