                    The practical applications of Lean Six Sigma are general enough to fit almost any industry but specific enough to require
                    usage to be in a company or industry setting. It is a data-based and fact-driven method to help eliminate waste such as time,
                    resources, or energy to make companies and industries more effective. Despite having general guidelines,  it is flexible
                    enough for companies to make changes unique to their situation so no two uses have been exactly the same. In addition to what
                    it does for a company or industry, there are added benefits for people who use it and are trained in it. The people who are
                    trained and certified in LSS are highly sought after, typically boasting higher paychecks, more job proposals, and other such
                    items. While Lean Six Sigma is great for facts based on data, that's all it's good for. When it comes to hypothetical ways to
                    deal with waste, it is not much help. It also falls through when there are unknown variables, like where the numbers run through
                    and should be checking out fine but are not. Another example where Lean Six Sigma is not especially usefultargeted for, is
                    increasing employee performance. Now, that does not mean it will not help employees, but it will not help the employees that
                    slack off or are simply uninterested in putting forth the necessary effort. Lean Six Sigma is not an advertisement system so if
                    your business or industry has low sales saying "we use Six Sigma" will not help. Using certain methods could help increase the
                    desire to work for your company by increasing customer loyalty and perceived trustworthiness, but it is not a guarantee.
