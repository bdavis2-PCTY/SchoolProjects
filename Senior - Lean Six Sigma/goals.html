					The implementation of Lean Six Sigma is sometimes considered one of the biggest changes to the
					service industry. Simply put, Lean Six Sigma aims to increase the profits of a company or business
					by eliminating variability, defects, and wastes that can undermine customer loyalty. Splitting up
					this statement reveals the four main goals of Lean Six Sigma: customer satisfaction, adding value,
					eliminate waste and increase flow, and capitalizing on opportunities. No matter the type of business
					or company, customer satisfaction is always a priority. Customers who are satisfied with a product
					or service are more likely to return to that same product or service instead of a different one,
					which will grant more profit in the future. Adding value to your product is another aspect of
					business that is required for all types of businesses. Adding value to your product can increase
					the trustworthiness of your product or business compared to competitors. When the value of a product
					increases, so does the trustworthiness. This can make customers more likely to buy your product over
					a competitor's. Eliminating waste and increasing flow are also important for every business.
					Businesses are more likely to be successful if they try to eliminate some of the eight forms of
					waste: defects, overproduction, waiting, non-utilized talent, transportation, inventory, motion,
					and extra processing. Eliminating unnecessary expenditures in these categories can increase the
					flow of a business, thus increasing effectiveness and profit. The last main goal, capitalizing on
					opportunities, focuses on taking advantage of value-generating opportunities and making profit from
					them. There are often activities or opportunities where a business can make a profit, but these are
					sometimes wasted. A business can improve these value-generating opportunities and actually make a
					profit from them if it is done correctly.
