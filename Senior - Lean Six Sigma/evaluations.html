						<div class="evalQuote">Lean Six Sigma is something that could be very useful to most businesses. Since it focuses on improving businesses and eliminating mistakes, it would make sense for employees to practice it. However, Lean Six Sigma sounds like it only applies to the business world. What if Lean Six Sigma could be applied for other uses? Regardless, Lean Six Sigma has proven to be useful, and it will continue to be in the future.</div>

						<div class="evalQuote">Being a data-based and factual person myself, I find Lean Six Sigma anywhere from interesting to fascinating. This practice should be implemented anywhere possible, especially where there is still capacity to grow. Numbers don't lie and Lean Six Sigma is showing that it is extremely effective.</div>

						<div class="evalQuote">I think Lean Six Sigma should be applied in all businesses. Improvement is something that every business desires, no matter what it is. Using Lean Six Sigma, any business can be improved. I think that every business today should already be using the techniques of Lean Six Sigma to improve, and if they aren't they should start doing so immediately.</div>

						<div class="evalQuote">Lean Six Sigma&#39;s focus on preventing rather than correcting mistakes reminds me of a commonly implemented set of processes used in programming known as Agile Development. I have used this in the past and I can vouch for its effectiveness. The goals of Lean Six Sigma are honorable and I trust in its ability to eliminate many wastes if used correctly.</div>

						<div class="evalQuote">Lean Six Sigma is a way for business to be more efficient and increase the success of the business. It works by eliminating waste, variability, and defects in the company. I believe that if any company wants to be successful, they need to be implementing Lean Six Sigma, otherwise they're going to fail.</div>

						<div class="evalQuote">Lean Six Sigma is a process that is useful but only in particular situations. The smaller the company, the less effective it seems to be as the quality assurance process requires large quantities to make a difference.</div>
