				<p>If youâ€™ve ever noticed that your workplace has improved work standardization and flow and eliminated waste, then that is Lean Six Sigma at work, but what exactly is Lean Six Sigma? Lean Six Sigma is a philosophy that revolves around correcting and preventing mistakes made in business. This allows the business to be more optimized for work, earn more customers, and gain competitive advantages. Every workplace has the opportunity to perform Lean Six Sigma and most employees practice it throughout their work. This is unlike Six Sigma itself, which is set on eliminating process variation while also improving process control. Despite their differences, workers who practice Six Sigma should know how to use both versions. More and more workers are using both Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma to attain positive results, because workplace process improvement requires aspects of each, and using them together will produce the best results. Many employees practice Six Sigma and Lean Six Sigma. Overall, Lean Six Sigma is designed to eliminate waste in the workplace and improve the working conditions to give a business a competitive advantage over other businesses.</p>
